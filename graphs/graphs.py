Problem Statement
------------------

A cycle exists when you traverse the directed graph and come upon a node that 
has already been visited.

You have to implement the detect_cycle function which tells you whether or not a graph contains a cycle.

# Input
A directed graph.

# Output
True if a cycle exists. False if it doesnâ€™t.

# Tests
g1 = AdjacencyListDAG(4)
g1.add_edge(0, 1)
g1.add_edge(1, 2)

g1.add_edge(3, 0)
g2 = AdjacencyListDAG(3)
g2.add_edge(0, 1)
g2.add_edge(1, 2)

print(detect_cycle(g1) == True)
print(detect_cycle(g2) == False)

Problem Statement
-----------------
You have to implement the find_mother_node() function which will 
take a directed graph as an input and find out which node is the mother 
node in the graph.

By definition, the mother node is one from which all other nodes are 
reachable. A graph can have multiple mother nodes, but you only need to 
find one.

Returns the value of the mother node if it exists. Otherwise, it returns -1
